## Submission (Autograder Policy)

This is important, please read carefully:

* The first person to complete a working version should submit it to the autograder to check the grade.
* After confirming the grade, **add me or you as a group member.**
* **CRITICAL:** The autograder requires you to **re-add group member on every single resubmission.**

## Current Status

* I have pushed all the necessary MATLAB and Python files for Project 3 to this repository.
* My work so far has been primarily in Python (using numpy).
* **Communication:** If you run into any issues, blockers, or errors, please document them in the [Issues / Blockers](#%EF%B8%8F-issues--blockers) section at the bottom of this README.

## To-Do List

Based on the project description, here is our immediate plan:

* **Part 1 (Proof):** **On Hold.** We will work on this once the guidelines are uploaded to Ed.
