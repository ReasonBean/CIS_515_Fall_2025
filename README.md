## Deadline: November 3, 2025

## Submission (Autograder Policy)

This is important, please read carefully:

* We can submit our output to the autograder as many times as we need to check our work.
* Once I or you have a final version, FULL score grade, **add me or you as a group member.**
* **CRITICAL:** The Gradescope requires me or you to **re-add the group member on every single resubmission.**

## Current Status

* I have pushed all the necessary MATLAB and Python files for Project 3 to this repository.
* My work so far has been primarily in Python (using numpy).
* **Communication:** If you run into any issues, blockers, or errors, please document them in the [Issues / Blockers](#%EF%B8%8F-issues--blockers) section at the bottom of this README.

## To-Do List

Based on the project description, here is our immediate plan:

* **Part 1 (Proof):** **On Hold.** We will work on this once the guidelines are uploaded to Ed.
* **Part 1 (2) -  Compute Boor control points:** → **In Progress.**
